## Note
One thing to note is that in this app, the keyword "q" is utilized extensively to return to prior menus. Thus, it is recommended to avoid using the keyword "q", along with others like "-1", which perform similarly to "q". It is also recommended to quit the app properly via the menu options; otherwise, it may result in unintended behaviors.
