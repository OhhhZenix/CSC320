# Module 1
In this module we were asked to create a simple program in java.

## The scenario chosen

Demonstrate understanding of basic programming concepts by:

1. Developing pseudocode that prints the following information for a fictional person:
    * First name
    * Last name
    * Street address
    * City
    * Zip code
2. Creating a simple java application that will print the items listed above on individual lines.

## How to run it
Ensure your current working directory is "./Module 1/" however if you are in the CSC320 directory you can get to this directory simply by doing the following command:
```
cd '.\Module 1\'
```
or 
```
cd Module\ 1/
```

We can utilize the javac command to compile the file.
```
javac Main.java
```
Next, we can run the code by simply using the java command by calling the class name.
```
java Main
```
Now, enjoy the program as it asks you some questions and guides you through it.
