# Temperature Reader
A simple java program that deals with temperature readings.

## Overview
This Java program allows users to retrieve temperature data for its respective day of the week or the entire week, depending on the user's input when prompted. Users may input the day of the week or simply "week" to obtain an overview of the weekly average temperature alongside the temperatures of all the days.

## Usage
1. Ensure you are in the correct directory of the source code.
2. Run ```javac TemperatureReader.java``` to compile the code.
3. Run ```java TemperatureReader``` to start the program.
4. When prompted, enter the day of the week or "week" for a week overview.
5. View the temperature of the day of the week or weekly average alongside all the days depending on input.

## Examples

## Note
The program takes in user input as a string only. Additionally, the program utilizes two arrays to store the days of the week and their corresponding average temperatures.
